*the repo behind the repos*


Please create a Github Issue on this repository for anything related to BeerJS generally,
for example, to ask for the creation of a new repo for your local chapter of BeerJS

We use github (this website!) to discuss things. If you're not used to that, here's a [quick video intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlrJVSJRUN4).

Also, you can [chat with us on slack](https://beers-slack-invite.herokuapp.com)!

## fork a beerjs in your city

Anyone can do it- why not you? Please open an issue on this repo and clearly state:
- **the github usernames of everyone who should be an admin on the repo**. we find that having at least 2 is best, but if it's just you, that's fine for now.
- **the name of the repo**. this becomes the url slug, eg `beerjs/foo`. if your city has a short name, like an airport code, that's fine. whatever you like that's still recognizable as your city.
- **bonus: gifs or emoji** are always welcome
- we will try to get you setup within in a couple of days.  Sometimes it may take a little longer as this is us giving time to the JS community.  Please have a little patience if things do not happen as fast as you want.  It's totally ok to ask for an update in the comments or contact Jordan on Slack :)


Once you have a repo created, encourage people in your town to "watch" the repo to subscribe to notifications for issues on github. Issues are a great way to propose, plan, and remind people of upcoming events. Filling out a readme, description, and optional URL to your repo will help people know what's going on and want to come to your cool event. Feel free to borrow text and formatting from other beer.js repos.

## [beerjs is on Slack](https://beerjs.slack.com)

We have a slack team now! Join it [here](https://beers-slack-invite.herokuapp.com). Each city is encouraged to create their own channel.

## get help organizing

A great way is to open an issue, or browse through some of the repos from other cities to see what they're up to.

## code of conduct

All events, activities, and internet spaces which bear the beer.js name are subject to the [Citizen Code of Conduct](http://citizencodeofconduct.org/). Simply stated, harassment of any form will not be tolerated and should be reported to your local organizer or to [@jordanpapaleo](https://twitter.com/jordanpapaleo). Please drink responsibly and act in a way that honors the community values of respect and mutual enrichment which we share.

## a note about beer

BeerJS is about creating social spaces to strengthen software communities. There is no requirement to drink to participate.

## tools to help you

Starting a JS community is not always easy.  Here are some [tools](https://github.com/beerjs/meta/blob/master/utils.md) to help you plan you events.

Feel free to create a pull request if you have useful resources for our group.

## why organize on Github?

See this thread from a local chapter: https://github.com/beerjs/abq/issues/6

## rules on donations (gentle suggestions)

BeerJS is not an organization that generates any sort of income.  Its not a non profit either.  This makes funding events a little more tricky.  In no way does having a chapter mean that you need to fund everything out of your pocket.  It is encouraged to find partners to work with you in growing our community.  Partners can be locations for your events, beer vendors, `Sticker Mule`, local companies, etc.

**Do this**

The Tahoe branch met at a cowork location for free and a local micro brewery would donate beer every month to support our efforts.  None of those groups ever asked for something in return.  They were supporters of building commmunity.

**Not this (totally made this up)**

A company has agreed to provide beer *if* it has access to the email addresses for the members of your community. A recruiter has offered to buy pizza *if* you let them use a meetup as a recruitment platform.

**Take away**

- Recruiters are part of our community.  Its ok if they want buy pizza or something to support the community because people are looking for jobs.  They can mingle and network just like the rest of us.
- Companies that want to give you a place to meet are wonderful because we need places to meet.
- Groups that print stickers probono are awesome because we all love stickers.
- **ANYONE** who offers something in exchange for something has alterior motives and needs to be avoided.  Do not owe anyone anything.

## stickers

Honestly, who doesn't love a good sticker? Do you run your local BeerJS events? Sticker Mule would like to support you, your efforts, and help our community grow. You can [request sponsorship here](https://www.stickermule.com/sponsorship/request).

If you just want to buy a couple of stickers: [BeerJS Sticker](https://www.stickermule.com/marketplace/11293-beerjs)
